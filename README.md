Analyses your Obsidian. Specifically does the following. It produces data that shows:

Growth Metrics

a) How many nodes are increasing over time
b) How many edges are increasing over time
c) How many connections are being averaged over time
d) Length of average note in the last month
Novelty/Idea Analysis Metrics

a) Average correlation of ideas/content across notes
b) Novelty of each note (Maybe normalise the log score over GPT3 to define 'novelty'?)
c) Random obsidian quality sampler (personal tool to call a random note and see if it is useful)
d) Recommend new topics where there aren't connections
e) Incorporate GPT4 search made by Rob Martin
