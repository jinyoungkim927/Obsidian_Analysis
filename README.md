# Obsidian Analysis Tool

This tool analyses your Obsidian vault and provides insights in the following areas:

## Growth Metrics
- **How many nodes are increasing over time.**
- **How many edges are increasing over time.**
- **How many connections are being averaged over time.**
- **Length of average note in the last month.**

## Novelty/Idea Analysis Metrics
- **Average correlation of ideas/content across notes.**
- **Novelty of each note** (Maybe normalize the log score over GPT-3 to define 'novelty'?).
- **Random obsidian quality sampler** (personal tool to call a random note and see if it is useful).
- **Recommend new topics where there aren't connections.**
- **Incorporate GPT-4 search** made by Rob Martin.
